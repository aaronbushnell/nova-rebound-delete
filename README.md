# Nova Rebound Delete

One of my favorite features of Sublime Text is using `CMD+Backspace` to delete the contents of a line and—if you are at the start of the line—it deletes it and moves up to the next one. I have a difficult time jumping between editors when this feature is missing. I created a small plugin to allow for this functionality.

## Usage

To run Rebound Delete you need to bind the `CMD+Backspace` key to **Editor → Delete Line using Rebound**
